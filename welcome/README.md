## Sanity Check
**Chall**
```
B0X_4U3_V4Q3
```
Submit the flag as cryptX{.*}

**Solution**

This is encoded with Caesar cipher, in which every character is shifted 3 times in the alphabet table and each number remains the same.
Wrap the decoded message in cryptX{} to get the flag.

**Flag**
```
cryptX{Y0U_4R3_S4N3}
```
